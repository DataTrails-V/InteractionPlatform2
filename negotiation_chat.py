        Dear Participant,

        Welcome to our interactive platform! This platform is designed to gather valuable insights into the performance of GPT models in negotiation scenarios. By analyzing your interactions, we aim to understand the fairness and behavior of AI in negotiation contexts, which will help inform future developments and improvements. Your participation is crucial, as it will provide essential data on how these AI models perform in simulated negotiations.

        **How to Participate**
        
        1. **Fill out the survey:** Start by completing a brief survey on the second page, which should take about 3 minutes. Your responses are crucial for understanding the context of each negotiation scenario. Please answer all questions as accurately and honestly as possible.
        2. **Choose a negotiation scenario:** After completing the survey, you'll be able to select from a list of suggested negotiation scenarios. Choose one that interests you or feels relevant. Background information about the chosen scenario, including your role, will be provided.
        3. **Engage with the chatbot:** Once you've selected a scenario, you can begin negotiating with the chatbot. Please limit the negotiation to no more than 7 rounds to ensure the process is concise and manageable.

        
        Please be assured that all information you provide will be kept confidential and used solely for research purposes. Your responses will be anonymized, and no personally identifiable information will be linked to your answers. No personal data will be shared with third parties. Participation in this study is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without any consequences. Participants must be at least 18 years old to take part in this study.

        This study is conducted by Veronika Tsishetska and Dr. Meltem Aksoy. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to contact us at veronika.tsishetska@tu-dortmund.de and meltem.aksoy@tu-dortmund.de.

        Thank you for your time and valuable contribution.

        The purpose of collecting your data is to conduct a thorough and effective research study aimed at understanding the negotiation dynamics in AI-mediated environments. Your participation will involve various negotiation tasks, and the data collected will be crucial for achieving the research objectives.

        **Nature of Data Collected:**
        We will collect data that may include your responses to surveys and questionnaires, details of your interactions with the chatbots, and any other inputs you provide during the study. This information will help us draw conclusions regarding fairness of the models.

        **How Your Data Will Be Used:**
        Your data will be analyzed to gain insights related to the research objectives. The findings may be shared with the academic community through publications, presentations, and reports. No personal data that could directly identify you will be used in any reports or publications.
